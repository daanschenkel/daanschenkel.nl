### SeasonMC - Developer & Manager

I was a developer and manager for a Minecraft server called SeasonMC. I managed the server and made plugins for it. I also made some business decisions.

### SnowCloud - Developer

I was a developer for a Minecraft server called SnowCloud. I made a web portal where users could notify of their absense, see the staff list, give strikes, appeal, promote/demote and more.

### Minecraft Quest - Full-stack developer

I am developing a website that shows users a bingocard, and lets them complete it in Minecraft. They are linked using Java and web APIs. This would automate (almost) the entire process of a Minecraft Quest.
